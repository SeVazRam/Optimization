# Optimization

This repository contains implementations and examples of optimization algorithms, covering both single-objective and multi-objective problems. The goal is to showcase classical and modern strategies applied to real-world and toy problems.

## Repository Structure


## Topics Covered

- **Single-Objective Optimization**  
  Solving problems where only one objective function is optimized (either minimized or maximized).  
  Implementations include:
  - Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
  - Other heuristic/metaheuristic methods

- **Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)**  
  Tackling problems with two or more conflicting objectives to find a trade-off (Pareto front).  
  Implementations include:
  - Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II, SPEA2)
  - MOPSO (Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- Common libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scipy`
  - *(optional in some notebooks)* `deap`, `pymoo`, `sklearn`

## Project Goals

This repository serves as:

- **An educational resource**: for learning, testing, and comparing optimization algorithms.
- **An experimentation base**: for extending or adapting algorithms to research or real-world problems.
- **A documented collection**: of optimization techniques with well-commented numerical examples.

## Upcoming Work

- Add real-world case studies (e.g., route optimization, structure design, energy planning).
- Implement advanced variants of PSO and EA.
- Include interactive visualizations for tracking solution evolution.

Let me know if you’d like the README templates for the two subfolders **Single_Objective_Optimization/** and **Multi_Objective_Optimization/** in English too — I can structure them as clean starter templates ready for your projects. Want me to go ahead?
