# Basic Multi-Objective Optimization: Weighted Sum and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

This notebook explores basic techniques for solving multi-objective optimization problems through two different approaches:

- **Weighted Sum Method**:  
  A classic technique that transforms a multi-objective problem into a single-objective one using a weighted linear combination.

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**:  
  A heuristic inspired by the social behavior of swarms, used to approximate the Pareto front in multi-objective scenarios.

The goal is to find solutions that balance two objective functions under a linear constraint.

## Problem Description

We aim to minimize two objective functions:

- $f_1(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$  (minimize distance to the origin)
- $f_2(x, y) = (x-1)^2 + y^2$  (minimize distance to the point (1,0))

Subject to the constraint:

- $x + y \geq 1$
